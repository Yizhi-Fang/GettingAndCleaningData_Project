# The procedures to analyze the data:
* Download the data file from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
* Unzip the data file as "UCI HAR Dataset"
* Create a folder that contains both data file folder and R script ```run_analysis.R```
* Set the working directory to this folder
* Run the R script ```run_analysis.R```
* Two data sets: one is the cleaned data with measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement saved in ```cleaned_data.txt```, the other is the average of each variable for each activity and each subject will be saved in the same folder with name ```mean_variables_per_activity_subject.txt```
* Refer to ```CodeBook.md``` for further information of variables, data and transformations made to clean up data
